- when an action is taken on a message or range, double check to see
  that internal message list is in sync with the one user is seeing. 
  maybe send over the subject line or something and make sure they
  match.

- let vmailsend take an ARGV of filenames, so use can use globs, etc.
  and send a bunch of emails at once.

- when showing seqno in message window, get it from the fetched
  envelope of the message instead of from the message_list item.

- make the 100 list batch limit adjustable, through some flag or env
  variable

- starring from msg window should keep the cursor there

- starred messages should be indicated as such in msg window

- after switching into a cached mailbox, check for update? or at least
  show when the mailbox was last updated.

- bug: mark as read a message, should update the cached version in
  current message list cache. FIXED

- refactor all the flagging business into tighter code

- let use mark msgs as unread

- if the top line in the list is in a range, it can get deleted. don't
  allow this. (minor)

- allow range commands from command prompt, such as VDelete, etc.
  because you can show line numbers and these may be useful.

- create an easy way to turn a regular / search into a mailbox search

- set ANSWERED flags and widen the flags column

- a way to label message (from Unix) and add label colors - make this
  truly orthogonal to mailboxes, unlike gmail.

- sent message mailbox not always updating

- still some message cache sync issues

- redesign the whole message cache system with unit testing
